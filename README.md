# 📅 Datepicker-UI

This is a **static datepicker UI** built using only **HTML and CSS**, inspired by the [roadmap.sh Datepicker UI project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui). While this version is not functional yet (i.e., no JavaScript), it provides a solid foundation for future interactivity.
