# 📅 Datepicker-UI

This is a **static datepicker UI** built using only **HTML and CSS**, inspired by the [roadmap.sh Datepicker UI project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui). While this version is not functional yet (i.e., no JavaScript), it provides a solid foundation for future interactivity.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in:

- CSS Grid and Flexbox layout
- Responsive design techniques
- Styling reusable UI components
- Structuring semantic HTML

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap Icons (for navigation arrows)

## 📐 Features

- Clean and simple calendar layout
- Weekday header (Sun to Sat)
- Month & Year display with left/right arrows (non-functional)
- Responsive grid layout for dates
- Styled date input using `<input type="date">`

## 📁 Folder Structure
```bash
Datepicker-UI/
│
├── src/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── index.css         # All calendar styling

│       └── index.html        # Main entry HTML file
│
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```




## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
